Describe the difference between lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries in Python. When would you choose to use one over the others? Explain the time complexity for common operations (access, insertion, deletion) for each.\n","\n","2.  Write a Python function that takes a string as input and returns the longest palindrome that can be built from the characters in the string. Note that you do not need to use all the characters and character order does not need to be preserved. For example, \"aabbc\" should return \"abba\".\n","\n","3.  Explain the concept of decorators in Python. Provide an example of how you would write a decorator that logs the execution time of a function.\n","\n","4.  How does Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) impact multithreaded applications? How can you work around the GIL to achieve true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks?\n","\n","5.  Implement a class in Python that represents a binary search tree. Include methods for insertion, deletion, search, finding the minimum value, and printing the tree in-order.\n","\n","6.  Explain the difference between `==` and `is` in Python. Provide code examples to illustrate the distinction. Discuss scenarios where using `is` is appropriate and when it is not.\n","\n","7.  Describe the concept of metaclasses in Python. Provide a simplified example of how you might use a metaclass to enforce a coding standard (e.g., requiring all attributes in a class to be documented).\n","\n","8.  Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the prime numbers from the original list. Optimize for performance when dealing with large lists.\n","\n","9.  Explain the purpose of context managers in Python (using the `with` statement). Provide an example of how to create a custom context manager for managing a database connection.\n","\n","10. Discuss the differences between asynchronous programming using `asyncio` and traditional multithreading in Python. Describe scenarios where each approach would be most suitable and why.\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"D5Dg4nfnwlef","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745499207408,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Viraj Belsare","userId":"05552365974056453014"}}},"execution_count":52,"outputs":[]}]}
